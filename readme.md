# Protocols for automated protein production and purification that run on Transcriptic 

## Public protocols 

Protcols that are tested and work 

- `public/kinetics.py` for determining Michaelis-Menten parameters of BglB mutants 

## Pilot protocols 

Protocols that are not tested and probably will not work as-is 

- `pilot/production_purification.py` for bacterial growth and protein purification 
- `pilot/thermal_stability.py` 
- `pilot/ssDNA_prep.py` prep of single-stranded DNA for Kunkel mutagenesis 

## Protocols we need that are already provided by Transcriptic 

- transformation 
- electrophoresis 

## Data analysis tools

See `bagel-fitter` (one of my repos) for automated data analysis of kinetic data
